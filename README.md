# IoT-based-Electricity-Monitoring-and-Controlling-System
## Objective:
  In the present stage of technology and digitalization an IoT become more power full tool in any field. We use IoT tools in electricity. Where we can reduce the illegal usage of electric power by setting limit. By illegal usage the consumption of electricity theft is responsible for economic problems for electric utilities due to revenue loss caused by electricity consumers that are not paying for it or late payment. The stealer has a tendency to consume more energy, resulting also in power quality problems. 
## Scope
 In both domestic and commercial connection, when consumer is spotted drawing power more than the sanction load, then they are levied power factor penalty and/or demand charges.By this project we find solution for illegal consumption of electricity. So in order to solve this problem, we propose an “IoT based electricity Monitoring and Controlling system”. From this project we can monitor the power usage readings, if the given electric power limit is exceeds, then the power will automatically cut off. From this we can consumes the electric power theft.
